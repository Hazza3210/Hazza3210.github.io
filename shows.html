				<p><b>THE DARK NIGHT</b></p>
				<p>Might be the best movie I have seen in all time. Heath Ledger playing as the joker was amazing (RIP).</p>

				<p><b>1917</b></p>
				<p>Masterpiece. The entire movie was mad in one shot. The cinematography was just out of this world.</p>

				<p><b>JOKER</b></p>
				<p>Joaquin Phoenix was the first actor to get to Heath ledgers league. He played the joker flawlessly.</p>

				<p><b>PEAKY BLINDERS</b></p>
				<p>This show was is basically to show off the power of this gang. Cillian Murphy is just too cold in this.</p>

				<p><b>GAME OF THRONES</b></p>
				<p>This was supposed to be the best TV show of all time. So sad the last season just ruined everything.</p>

			<article>
				<p><b>VIKINGS</b></p>
				<p>Same thing here, it was such a good show up to season 4. Killing off the maing character Ragnar killed the show with it.</p>
