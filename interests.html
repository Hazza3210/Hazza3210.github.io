				<p>My two main interests are two upcoming ones honestly; and they are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cybersecurity (Hacking). I am currently taking one intro course about each and they are both very interesting. The concepts around how to make technology human like and how computers work and how to breach through them are fascinating.</p>

				<p>Its interesting because my first choice was actully AI, and while it is cool to learn about machines becoming more like us, I thought its implementation was not the best. Hacking is becoming my passion though. I am reading and learning more about it whenever I get the chance. I also started writing code to make things easier. For example, I had to change 200 lines  from decimals (like 1.00) to integers (like 1), so instead of doing it myself I wrote a code that did it for me.</p>
