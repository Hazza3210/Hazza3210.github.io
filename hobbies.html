			<h2>Basically what I try to do and include every other day in my life.</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt style="text-align: left">BODYBUILDING</dt>
					<dd style="text-align: left">- For as long as I can remember I was the skinny kid.</dd>
					<dd>- I was extremely underweight and would be made fun of for it.</dd>
					<dd>- Recently, around 1-2 years ago, I started going to the gym. It was after leaving home for a long time to study in the US.</dd>
					<dd>- I did not have much to do so I decided to workout to pass the time. It started as a thing to do if I am bored and slowly became an addiction.</dd>
					<dd>- It helped me through many different ways. I now go to the gym almost every day and eat healthy meals to look and feel good.</dd>
					<dd>- Surprised everyone after going back home.</dd>

					<dt>SOCCER</dt>
					<dd>- Everyone I know plays this. Almost all the people at school would play this everyday on our free time.</dd>
					<dd>- I used to watch games with my family back home too.</dd>
					<dd>- I support FC Barcelona and Manchester City.</dd>
					<dd>- This sport was a really good ice breaker since everyone talks about it.</dd>

					<dt>VIDEOGAMES</dt>
					<dd>- I try my best to manage my time around this. This was my childhood.</dd>
					<dd>- I loved playing games as a kid. But it would always take over my time. I sadly cannot limit myself to a few hours a day.</dd>
					<dd>- I either play for the entire day or nothing.</dd>
					<dd>- Which is why I kept my PS5 at home. I limited myseld to only play videogames when I am back home, so basically on vacations.</dd>
