				<p>HELLO! My name is Hazaa AlAmeri. I come from the United Arab Emirates, AbuDhabi. I am currently a junior in UW-Madison manjoring in Computer Science. My interest in computer science and especially in the field of cybersecurity keeps increasing by the year. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows either alone or with friends/ Other than the tech stuff I like to workout. I go to the gym almost everyday for bodybuilding and I keep my eating in order. Lastly, I enjoy playing soccer, it is the most dominating sport back home and everyone I know plays it.</p>
